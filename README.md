# Motivation
With everything going on in the world today, I wanted to look at happiness levels around the world. There are many factors that affect happiness like freedom, GDP, support, life expectancy, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. I wondered what the relationships were between the happiness score and each factor and which factor was most closely correlated to the happiness score. 

# Data Process
When I started looking for data on this subject, I found a website dedicated to statistics about happiness around the world called the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/). As I went through the data, it had a lot of extra factors that I did not need for the purposes of this project. I found another data source which combined data from the World Happiness Report and data from the [Gallup World Poll](https://www.gallup.com/analytics/349487/gallup-global-happiness-center.aspx) to look at the factors that affect happiness and the overall happiness scores given to each country. As for cleaning the data, there wasn't a whole lot of processing that needed to be done. The data was already neatly organized and there were no values that were concerning enough to take out or change.
